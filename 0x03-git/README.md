---
| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Repo-session] | Create a new directory called `0x03-git` in your `holbertonschool-zero_day` repo. Make sure you include a `README.md` in your directory.  |
| [1. Coding fury road] | For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a `README.md`. It’s time to code!  |
| [2. Collaboration is the base of a company] | A `branch` is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly  |
| [3. Collaboration: be up to date](./up_to_date) | Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if you keep `up to date` with their changes.  |
| [4. HAAA what did you do???] | Collaboration is cool, but not really when you update the same file at the same time… To illustrate that, please `merge the branch update_script to master`: `“Cool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!”`  |
| [5. Never push too much](./.gitignore) | Create a `.gitignore` file and define a rule to never push `~` files (generated by Emacs).  |
