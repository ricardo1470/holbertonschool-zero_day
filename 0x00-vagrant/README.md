### 0. Create and setup your Git and Github account
Git is installed on the iMacs provided by Holberton, but if you’re using another computer, you might have to install it yourself.

* Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine – they will be part of your commits. Tips
On Github.com:

  * Using the graphic interface on the website, create your first repository
    Name: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
  * Description: `I'm now a Holberton Student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer Public repo`
  * No `README`, `.gitignore`, or license
  * On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:

Navigate to your home directory. Tips
  * Create a directory `holbertonschool-zero_day`. Tips
  * Navigate to this new directory. Tips
  * Initialize git and add the remote origin
  * Create a file `README.md` with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. **This file is mandatory in all Holberton School projects**
  * Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)
Good job!

You pushed your first file in your **first repository** of the **first task** of your **first Holberton School project.**
### [1. Hello Ubuntu](0-hello_ubuntu)
